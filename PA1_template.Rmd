```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{R, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(xtable)
activity = read.csv("activity.csv")
activity["Day"] = weekdays(as.Date(activity[,2], "%Y-%m-%d"))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{R}
total_steps_per_day = activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
hist(total_steps_per_day$steps, main = "Steps Per Day Histogram", xlab = "Steps", col = "royal blue")
```
```{R, echo =FALSE, results=FALSE}
print("")
```

```{R}
summary(total_steps_per_day)
```
We can see that the overall mean and median are given for our data in the steps column.  
**Median: 10,395**  
**Mean: 9,354**


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{R}
five_min_average = activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(five_mean = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
with(five_min_average, plot(interval, five_mean, type ="l"))
```

```{R}
five_min_average[five_min_average$five_mean == max(five_min_average[,2]),]
```
Interval 835 had the highest average with 206 steps. 


## Imputing missing values

```{R}
summary(activity)
```
We can see there is a total of 2304 NA's in the data set. 
Now we will fill in these NA's with their equivalent 5-minute interval average.

```{R}

completed_activity = activity
i = 0
while(i < dim(activity)[1]){
  i = i + 1
  if(is.na(completed_activity[i,1]) == TRUE){
    completed_activity[i,1] = five_min_average[five_min_average$interval == completed_activity[i,3], 2]
  }
}

print(head(completed_activity))
```

And now a new histogram with the updated data:

```{R}
mean_steps_per_day_completed = completed_activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
hist(mean_steps_per_day_completed$steps, main = "Steps Per Day Histogram", xlab = "Steps", col = "royal blue")
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{R}

week_class = factor(c("Weekend", "Weekday"))

i = 0
while(i < dim(completed_activity)[1]){
  i = i + 1
  if(completed_activity$Day[i] == "Saturday" || completed_activity$Day[i] == "Sunday"){
    completed_activity$week_class[i] =  as.character(week_class[1])
  }
  else {completed_activity$week_class[i] =  as.character(week_class[2])}
}

completed_activity$week_class = as.factor(completed_activity$week_class)
intervals_weekday = completed_activity[completed_activity$week_class == "Weekday",] %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
intervals_weekend = completed_activity[completed_activity$week_class == "Weekend",] %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
```
Now that we have mean intervals by weekend and weekday we can plot it. 

```{R}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
with(intervals_weekday, plot(interval, steps ,type="l", main = "Steps during weekday"))
with(intervals_weekend, plot(interval, steps ,type="l", main = "Steps during weekend"))
```

We can see that weekends have a much higher and constant step count per interval.
